# About me

Hi! My name is Ulises Santana, I am from Canary Islands, Spain. Land of sun and beaches. I am a web developer ending my studies. Before I started my coding studies I had been working as Social Media Manager. I consider Marketing very interesting, but I prefer working on coding and let people who love marketing working on it.

At this moment I am investigating on React.js and Node.js for the begining of my path to become a **full stack javascript** coder. I have been an internet boy since I was a kid. My geekness grow up with me across the years and finally become up into a falling love with the code.

Of course code is not my only love. Also love beer, who not? Beer with friends, beer at the beach, beer in a barbacue, etc. I spend my free time going to beach, walking along the city or just enoying time with my friends. If you want to know what I am talking about check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ulisesantana) <i class="fa fa-instagram" aria-hidden="true"></i>.
