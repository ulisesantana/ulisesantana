Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage’s HTML, to be run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user’s web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node.js enables JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, and runs scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user’s web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Node.js has become one of the foundational elements of the “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm, allowing web application development to unify around a single programming language, rather than rely on a different language for writing server side scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad

made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
