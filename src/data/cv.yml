      After being promoted, I am daily involved in developing features, even whole projects, on the backend and frontend side. Based on the team goal, could be just backend or frontend. This means working some sprints with AngularJS and Symfony, others with NestJS and React and sometimes just React or NodeJS and Express.

      I usually discuss the solutions with the Solution Architect or Team Leaders. Also, I introduced and evangelized things like TypeScript, Storybook, NestJS,  Microfrontends, Inner Source, Cypress, Husky, Jest or how to create npm packages among my teammates. 
      
      Besides, I help with another kind of tasks as maintaining development environments, assisting production deployments or recruiting React/NodeJS developers.

      After my internship at Kentech, I was hired as a Backend Developer due to my interest and performance in NodeJS tasks during my internship. In the first six months, my main tasks were coding new features on NodeJS microservices, helping the infrastructure area and handling deployments on our environments before CI/CD came to our lives. That means handling web servers with Nginx and pm2 processes for NodeJS, besides handling all the files on servers for other services. Thankfully, some really smart teammates deployed Rancher with Docker connected with our Gitlab, giving us the chance to add CI/CD on our workflow.

      During the following six months, I gradually stop working on infrastructure and started creating new features across all the stack. I also evangelized best practices about ES2017 Promises with async / await.

      The last part of the Higher Technician in development of web application certification is doing an internship in a company of your choice. I chose Kentech because was the only company I found in Gran Canaria who was using NodeJS at that time. Also, was a really good opportunity to test my English skills because the communication on Kentech is full in English.

      Kentech is a provider of custom solutions across various verticals, specializing in the online entertainment industry with a focus on sports in multiple countries. The applications build by Kentech are used by millions of users across the world.

      I started as a QA, but after some weeks testing the main web app, they gave me some tasks related to UI optimization for Opera Mini and creating a Wordpress theme for a corporative site. In the last weeks, my mentor, a NodeJS developer, explained to me the microservices architecture and some basics about high availability concepts. Also, he challenged me on the last week to do a proof of concept about a cache system with a distributed lock with MySQL and Redis.

      I co-founded a Digital Marketing Studio with a talented designer and a swiss army man of digital marketing who mentored me during my time in the studio and he also maintained the role of a leader since he is a born leader. 
      
      For two and a half years I worked creating content and executing digital marketing plans in different channels based on customer objectives, interacting with communities, following active listening and resolving reputation crises with a community manager under my charge. As a copywriter, I wrote all the content for the different blogs that we managed. I also made the content insertion in web projects using HTML and CSS.

      As co-founder, I lived putting out fires daily along with all the management of customers, products, and projects. On the other hand, trying to do the math to pay employee salaries, company debts and the taxes of being a small business in Spain. This kind of experience gave me more perspective about the cost of a digital product.
