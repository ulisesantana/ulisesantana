In the first six months, my main tasks were coding new features on NodeJS microservices, helping the infrastructure area and handling deployments on our environments before CI/CD came to our lives. That means handling web servers with Nginx and pm2 processes for NodeJS, besides handling all the files on servers for other services. Thankfully, some really smart teammates deployed Rancher with Docker connected with our Gitlab, giving us the chance to add CI/CD on our workflow.\nDuring the following six months, I gradually stop working on infrastructure and started creating new features across all the stack. I also evangelized best practices about ES2017 Promises with async / await.\n","location":"Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain","from":"06/2017","employer":"Kentech","skills":["NodeJS","AngularJS","Socket.io","PHP7","MySQL","MongoDB","Microservices","Redis","Docker","Docker Swarm","Slack","Portainer","Rancher","Gitlab","WordPress","Toggl","Jira","Confluence","Rocket Chat","Visual Studio Code","Webstorm","PHPStorm"],"position":"Back End Developer","to":"07/2018"},{"description":"The last part of the Higher Technician in development of web application certification is doing an internship in a company of your choice.
