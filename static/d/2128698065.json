Based on the team goal, could be just backend or frontend. This means working some sprints with AngularJS and Symfony, others with NestJS and React and sometimes just React or NodeJS and Express.\nI usually discuss the solutions with the Solution Architect or Team Leaders. Also, I introduced and evangelized things like TypeScript, Storybook, NestJS,  Microfrontends, Inner Source, Cypress, Husky, Jest or how to create npm packages among my teammates. \nBesides, I help with another kind of tasks as maintaining development environments, assisting production deployments or recruiting React/NodeJS developers.\n","location":"Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain","from":"08/2018","employer":"Kentech","skills":["NodeJS","AngularJS","React","TypeScript","Storybook","Jest","Husky","testing-library","Socket.io","PHP7","MySQL","MongoDB","Microservices","Microfrontends","Redis","Docker","Portainer","Rancher","Gitlab","Express","NestJS","Toggl","Jira","Confluence","Slack","Visual Studio Code","Webstorm"],"position":"Full Stack Developer","to":"Now"},{"description":"After my internship at Kentech, I was hired as a Backend Developer due to my interest and performance in NodeJS tasks during my internship. In the first six months, my main tasks were coding new features on NodeJS microservices, helping the infrastructure area and handling deployments on our environments before CI/CD came to our lives. That means handling web servers with Nginx and pm2 processes for NodeJS, besides handling all the files on servers for other services. Thankfully, some really smart teammates deployed Rancher with Docker connected with our Gitlab, giving us the chance to add CI/CD on our workflow.\nDuring the following six months, I gradually stop working on infrastructure and started creating new features across all the stack. I also evangelized best practices about ES2017 Promises with async / await.\n","location":"Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain","from":"06/2017","employer":"Kentech","skills":["NodeJS","AngularJS","Socket.io","PHP7","MySQL","MongoDB","Microservices","Redis","Docker","Docker Swarm","Slack","Portainer","Rancher","Gitlab","WordPress","Toggl","Jira","Confluence","Rocket Chat","Visual Studio Code","Webstorm","PHPStorm"],"position":"Back End Developer","to":"07/2018"},{"description":"The last part of the Higher Technician in development of web application certification is doing an internship in a company of your choice. I chose Kentech because was the only company I found in Gran Canaria who was using NodeJS at that time.

The applications build by Kentech are used by millions of users across the world.\nI started as a QA, but after some weeks testing the main web app, they gave me some tasks related to UI optimization for Opera Mini and creating a Wordpress theme for a corporative site. In the last weeks, my mentor, a NodeJS developer, explained to me the microservices architecture and some basics about high availability concepts. Also, he challenged me on the last week to do a proof of concept about a cache system with a distributed lock with MySQL and Redis.\n","location":"Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain","from":"03/2017","employer":"Kentech","skills":["NodeJS","AngularJS","Quality Assurance","PHP7","MongoDB","Gitlab","Docker","WordPress","Jira","Confluence","Rocket Chat","Visual Studio Code","Webstorm","PHPStorm","Opera Mini Optimization"],"position":"Web Developer Intern","to":"05/2017"},{"description":"I was the web developer in a small studio of web development and digital marketing.
