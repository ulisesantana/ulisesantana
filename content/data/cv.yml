about: >
  I was thinking about defining myself in a sentence, but I concluded that's an impossible task. So let me simply describe myself. I am a  lifelong learner passionate about tech, focused on the web with JavaScript as my native programming language and I solve problems with tech based on JavaScript.

  I believe that for a healthy industry the professionals must share their experience. Committed to this, I try to give at least one talk/workshop per year in vocational schools. Moreover, I co-organized and sponsored the last Global Day of Coderetreat in Gran Canaria, which is an awesome environment for coding students.

  I also sponsored other events during the last years as part of my giveback plan to the software community. There is no doubt that software communities and open source have been crucial for my professional growth, so I am just returning the favor.

      After being promoted, I am daily involved in developing features, even whole projects, on the backend and frontend side. Based on the team goal, could be just backend or frontend. This means working some sprints with AngularJS and Symfony, others with NestJS and React and sometimes just React or Node.js and Express.

      I usually discuss the solutions with the Solution Architect or Team Leaders. Also, I introduced and evangelized things like TypeScript, Storybook, NestJS,  Microfrontends, Inner Source, Cypress, Husky, Jest or how to create npm packages among my teammates.

      Besides, I help with another kind of tasks as maintaining development environments, assisting production deployments or recruiting React/Node.js developers.

      After my internship period, I was hired as a Backend Developer due to my interest and performance in Node.js tasks during my internship. In the first six months, my main tasks were coding new features on Node.js microservices, helping the infrastructure area and handling deployments on our environments before CI/CD came to our lives. That means handling web servers with Nginx and pm2 processes for Node.js, besides handling all the files on servers for other services. Thankfully, some really smart teammates deployed Rancher with Docker connected with our Gitlab, giving us the chance to add CI/CD on our workflow.

      During the following six months, I gradually stop working on infrastructure and started creating new features across all the stack. I also evangelized best practices about ES2017 Promises with async / await.

      The last part of the Higher Technician in development of web application certification is doing an internship in a company of your choice. I chose Kentech because was the only company I found in Gran Canaria who was using Node.js at that time. Also, was a really good opportunity to test my English skills because the communication on Kentech is full in English.

      Kentech is a provider of custom solutions across various verticals, specializing in the online entertainment industry with a focus on sports in multiple countries. The applications build by Kentech are used by millions of users across the world.

      I started as a QA, but after some weeks testing the main web app, they gave me some tasks related to UI optimization for Opera Mini and creating a Wordpress theme for a corporative site. In the last weeks, my mentor, a Node.js developer, explained to me the microservices architecture and some basics about high availability concepts. Also, he challenged me on the last week to do a proof of concept about a cache system with a distributed lock with MySQL and Redis.

      For two and a half years I worked creating content and executing digital marketing plans in different channels based on customer objectives, interacting with communities, following active listening and resolving reputation crises with a community manager under my charge. As a copywriter, I wrote all the content for the different blogs that we managed. I also made the content insertion in web projects using HTML and CSS.

      As co-founder, I was involved in managing customers, products, and projects. Furthermore, a lot of problems come up on the daily basis of a business and somebody needs to handle it. On the other hand, trying to do the math to pay employee salaries, company debts and the taxes of being a small business in Spain. This kind of experience gave me more perspective about the cost of a digital product.
