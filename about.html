  About me
</h1>
<p>
Hi! My name is Ulises Santana, I am from Canary Islands, Spain. Land of sun and
beaches. I am a web developer ending my studies. Before I started my coding
studies I had been working as Social Media Manager. I consider Marketing very
interesting, but I prefer working on coding and let people who love marketing
working on it.
</p>
<p>
At this moment I am investigating on React.js and Node.js for the begining of
my path to become a <strong>full stack javascript</strong> coder. I have been an internet
boy since I was a kid. My geekness grow up with me across the years and finally
become up into a falling love with the code.
</p>
<p>
Of course code is not my only love. Also love beer, who not? Beer with friends,
beer at the beach, beer in a barbacue, etc. I spend my free time going to beach,
walking along the city or just enoying time with my friends. If you want to know
what I am talking about check out my
